<p>Greetings, this is a work in progress, page and music I'll probably be making for the rest of my life. I&rsquo;ll update it whenever I make something I&rsquo;m actually proud of.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find stuff I&rsquo;ve composed and produced here. My best work and others that I may not like very much, but they can show the little variety I can make.</p>
<p>Feel free to give me feedback &mdash; whether you make music or not. Quality is what I'm supposed to give, even if it&rsquo;s just a hobby.</p>
<p>Most of the songs may have big dates gap, since I never really wanted to make this something "serious", I just started to actually want to improve.</p>

<p><strong>For other projects: Fanthemes and covers</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/njQVtAC6zL4?si=pykgmckj5CR7RF9M">Fer Owns</a> this one was a fantheme for <a href="https://mspfa.com/?s=25665&amp;p=7">Cheatstuck</a>, I like it, but have a lot of issues. I also made two songs for the game, but they were so bad I can't even show them...</p>
<p><a href="lust encounter.html">Lust Encounter</a> April 2025. While waiting for the demo of this indie game to drop, I thought it'd be interesting to try making a song with the little I knew, just based on the design and the concept of lust, or something like that?. I dunno, but I think it turned out pretty neat. Give it a shot. Also, I used this song to improve a little my structure for composing and production, which I really hope it shows...!</p>

<p>Exterminate, this one is the better one (I think). It was a little game I was making all by myself, but my computer died, so I lost everything, but at least I got 4 tracks saved, give it a try!</p>

<p><strong>My early songs (old to recent)</strong></p>

<p>This is my first song; it isn't perfect, but I'm still proud of it. I have nostalgic feelings about it, I remember taking a whole month (when my mom wasn't at home hearing me lol) to make an actual "decent" thing.</p>
<p>Don't make ideas from the date of upload, I don't have that much experience, since I used to tend to make pauses for months.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/m8QYIrJZv_Y?si=6A5_CsYT9kWWu-zE">Fast as light</a> this one was for my best friend, there is nothing much to say, I like it, but it is kinda old.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/kjaciIzv-1Y?si=toPQnWPM8p3fizsz">Big Deal</a> One of my favorites so far, could be better in some aspects, but I still love it.</p>
<p><br /><a href="castlevania.html">Castlevania attempt</a> made this one not so much time ago, I think it's fine but could be better, also didn't know how to finish it.</p>
